# WeatherGUI
This is my personal project that utilizes API's to collect weather information, and hen display it using a tkinter GUI. I used the OpenWeatherMap API, and used a the 
custom tkinter library to allow for greater creatice design choices over my GUI. This application takes an input from the user for a city, then after clicking the 
"Check Weather" button, it displays the current temperature, feels like temperature, and description of the weather. This code was written completely in python.
